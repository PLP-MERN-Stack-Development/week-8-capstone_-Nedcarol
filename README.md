📈 Future Roadmap
✅ MVP Completion (products, courses, checkout)

🔜 Full Mobile App (React Native or Flutter)

🔜 Affiliate/Referral System

🔜 Student Progress Tracker

🔜 Integrate Flutterwave for Africa-friendly payments

🔜 Analytics dashboard for sellers and instructors

💬 Stripe Note (Regional Issue)
❗ Stripe is not supported in many African countries.
